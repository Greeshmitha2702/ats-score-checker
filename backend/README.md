# Backend - FastAPI

This folder will contain the FastAPI backend for the ATS Score Checker. The backend will provide API endpoints to receive the resume and job description, process them, and return an ATS score.

## Next Steps
- Initialize a FastAPI app here
- Set up endpoints for file upload and scoring
- Connect to MongoDB for data storage
