# ATS Score Checker - Project Structure

This project is a full stack application for checking ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scores by comparing a user's resume with a job description (JD). It is built for learning purposes with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend:** React.js (in /frontend)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (in /backend)
- **Database:** MongoDB (in /database)

## Folder Structure

- `/frontend` - React.js application (user interface for uploading resume and JD, displaying score)
- `/backend` - FastAPI application (API endpoints for processing resumes, JDs, and scoring logic)
- `/database` - MongoDB setup and scripts (for local development)

## Getting Started

1. Set up the frontend React app in `/frontend`.
2. Set up the backend FastAPI app in `/backend`.
3. Set up MongoDB for local development in `/database`.

Each section will have its own README and setup instructions as you build the project.

*This project is structured for learning. As you build each part, you will learn about project setup, API design, frontend-backend communication, and database integration.*
