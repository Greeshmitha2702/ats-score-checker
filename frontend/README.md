# Frontend - React.js

This folder will contain the React.js application for the ATS Score Checker. The frontend will allow users to upload their resume and job description, and display the ATS score returned from the backend.

## Next Steps
- Initialize a React app here (e.g., using `npx create-react-app .`)
- Build UI for file uploads and score display
- Connect to the FastAPI backend
